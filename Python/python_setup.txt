HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

For a freshly updated installation of requests module and couchbase python client (that has the fixes for the new requests object too), do these commands:

$[sudo] pip install --update requests

$[sudo] pip install https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client/tarball/master


Also for the nice colored terminal output in the samples:

$[sudo] pip install blessings
